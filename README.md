## Overview

TastePepAI is a comprehensive artificial intelligence platform designed for customized taste peptide design and safety assessment. This innovative framework addresses the significant challenges in traditional taste peptide discovery by providing an end-to-end automated solution for generating novel taste peptides with desired organoleptic properties while ensuring safety profiles.

The platform integrates advanced machine learning algorithms, including a novel **Loss-supervised Adaptive Variational Autoencoder (LA-VAE)** for controlled peptide generation and **SpepToxPred** for toxicity prediction, enabling researchers to design taste peptides with specific flavor profiles (sweet, salty, umami, sour, bitter) while avoiding unwanted taste characteristics.

## Key Features

- **AI-Driven Peptide Generation**: Utilizes LA-VAE with contrastive learning for precise control of taste properties
- **Comprehensive Safety Assessment**: Integrated toxicity prediction using SpepToxPred with >82% accuracy
- **Taste Avoidance Mechanism**: Selective flavor exclusion capabilities for customized peptide design
- **Automated Workflow**: Complete pipeline from design to physicochemical analysis
- **Multi-taste Capability**: Simultaneous prediction and design of peptides with multiple taste modalities
- **Experimental Validation**: Successfully designed and validated 73 novel taste peptides
